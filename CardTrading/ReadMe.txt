This application uses a JSON file that contains a list of cards and randomly allocates 10 new user cards. The application supports logging in and uses sessions to keep track of the currently logged-in user giving the feel of a game. The game is all about collecting your favourite cards. The game is portrayed in a Yu-Gi-Yo style since that is what I grew up playing. However, the cards are not from that game. Friend requests, and trades are handled by Jquery which updates a specific Div, every set interval.
