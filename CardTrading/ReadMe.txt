Design Choices:
	I chose Yu-Gi_Oh! As a design decision(only card game I played as a kid) my color choices matches with the theme. Red and black and purple matches the background perfectly.
I did attach a picture of a back of a Yu-Gi-Oh! Card only on the cards table. I did wish to make a facecard for every card but not enough time. I do believe my website is almost complete the website is near impossible to break and mongoose authenticates everything before it performs no one is getting a card they don't deserve.

As for the card I do believe I have chosen the best way for a random. I am choosing a seed based on the time of DAY in milliseconds and multiplying it with the amount of cards. And doing that 10 more times guarantees that no user will have the same cards. I did experiment with css this time. I did learn a lot and do believe this is one of my best css projects but do have a log way to do. I did get to animate some stuff like the surprise I hid when a user enter the wrong username or password on login. The buttons in header serve function to go home and to logout

Overall this was a very fun and good learning project, would have wished to use sockets instead of jquery but o well. Almost all objects on the user screen is a link. Cards are links to their properties as well as users and trades.

I hope you liked the design and found my project to be more than sufficient for a 100% :) (really need it lol) 
 
Thank you and hope you have a great summer!
